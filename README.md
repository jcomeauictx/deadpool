deadpool is an Ethereum contract that allows
[betting](https://wikipedia.org/dead%20pool) on the date and time of an
individual's death.

it can also be used as a form of crowdfunded life insurance, as well as for
an [incentive](http://www.outpost-of-freedom.com/jimbellap.htm) for tyrants
to voluntarily disappear and never be seen again. while it doesn't implement
Jim's idea in all details, it might suffice.
